# Docker_model_deployment
This repository contains a project involving building a machine learning model, creating data pipelines, setting up a Flask API, Dockerizing the application, and testing the API using cURL requests.
# Step 1 
Preparing Data for Model Building
Ensuring that We have the necessary data for training our machine learning model. This involves collecting, cleaning, and preprocessing data to make it suitable for training.
# Step 2
Building Data Pipelines
Created data pipelines to automate the process of fetching, preprocessing, and feeding data into our machine learning model. This ensures efficiency and reproducibility.
# Step 3
Using Flask to Create API
Utilize Flask, created an API that exposes our machine learning model's functionality. Define endpoints for handling requests and serving predictions.
# Step 4
Building a Dockerfile: Generate Docker Image
Writing a Dockerfile to specify the environment and dependencies required for running our Flask API. This Dockerfile will be used to build a Docker image encapsulating our application.
# Step 5
Run the Docker Container
Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile and then run a Docker container based on that image.
# Step 6
Tested API Using cURL Request
Once the Docker container is running, tested the API endpoints using cURL requests. Sent requests to the defined endpoints and verify the responses.
